    Welcome to the human evaluation for legal-text simplification tool. Here are the instructions on how to use this tool:

    ## Background
    Legal texts are often complex and difficult for everyday users to understand. Simplifying these texts can make them more accessible and easier to comprehend. In this evaluation tool, you will be assessing simplified versions of original legal texts.

    ## Purpose
    We have a total of 200 original legal texts that need simplification. For each original text, there are 11 different simplified versions generated by 8 machine learning models and 3 human experts. This results in a total of 2200 text pairs for evaluation. You will be presented with random pairs for each original text, and your task is to evaluate the quality of these simplifications.

    ## How to Evaluate
    For each text pair, you will be asked to evaluate three aspects: adequacy, fluency, and simplicity. Each aspect should be rated on a scale from 0 to 4.

    - **Adequacy**: How well does the simplified text preserve the meaning of the original text?
      - 0: Not at all
      - 1: Poorly
      - 2: Fairly
      - 3: Well
      - 4: Perfectly

    - **Fluency**: How fluent and natural does the simplified text read?
      - 0: Not at all
      - 1: Poorly
      - 2: Fairly
      - 3: Well
      - 4: Perfectly

    - **Simplicity**: How much simpler is the simplified text compared to the original text?
      - 0: Not at all
      - 1: Slightly simpler
      - 2: Moderately simpler
      - 3: Considerably simpler
      - 4: Extremely simpler

    ## Navigation
    You can navigate through the text pairs using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons. Make sure to save your evaluation for each pair using the "Save Evaluation" button.

    ## Downloading Results
    Once you have completed your evaluations, you can download the results by clicking the download link provided at the bottom of the page.

    ## To Keep in Mind
    - There are a total of 2200 pairs to evaluate.
    - You will be presented with random pairs for each original text.
    - It is natural to encounter with original text pair more than once since there are 11 simplified versions for each original text.
    - The original text might be simple enough, so you might not see a significant difference between the original and simplified versions.

    ## Current Problems
    - You might encounter with absurd chracaters in the text. This is due to the encoding problem. Please ignore these characters and focus on the text content.

    Thank you for your participation!
